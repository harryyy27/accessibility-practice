# Acessibility Practice #

Began as a simple accessibility and front-end testing exercise.. turned into a full blown HTML Canvas ball pit.

## Accessibility ## 

Used every accessibility trick in the book to make a very accessible navbar and modal.
  
## Testing ##

Tested all front end functions with the exception of keydown event listeners.
  
## HTML Canvas ##

Animated the webpage with a series of moving spheres. Gave the mouse its own "gravitational" field
